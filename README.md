# Notes API

Codded 95% by myself other 5% was new code which i hadent learnt yet which i needed ai for a bit of assistnace. For easier time debugging i useing AI and codded its suggestions by myself no copy and paste because thats just boring.

Still in progress.

May add a react front end side so it looks good and is user freindly.

Also i hate useing postman and having to organize my auth tokens by name in the headers section.
